# AGRIBOT
The Agri-Bot is a robot designed to perform several agricultural operations like sowing seeds, spraying weedicides and detecting disease in crops. Its body is inspired by the space rovers so that it can cover any kind of uneven surfaces in the field and be lightweight at the same time. The robot was first designed in Solidworks and then built with some parts being 3-D printed and some made with aluminum.   
It is a six-wheel drive which is steered with the help of four servo motors at the front and the rear wheels. It is operated by RC control to m1ove along the field.  
The seed sowing mechanism has a tooth that drags along the soil to make a groove in the soil in which the seed dropper places the seeds.
